## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Laravel Spot Test Project

### Objective

This project is a PHP-based application designed to demonstrate the creation of a REST API for processing new orders, integrating with a third-party API, and handling high demand for API requests efficiently. The project is implemented using the Laravel framework, adhering to the MVC design pattern, and includes both backend and frontend components.

### Features

#### REST API for New Orders:

- The API endpoint processes new orders and includes authentication.
- The API request body contains at least two parameters: Customer Name and Order Value.
- The API response includes Order ID, Process ID, and Status parameters.
- The data is stored in a MySQL database.
 
 #### Third-Party API Integration:

- Upon successful order processing, the order details are submitted to a specified third-party API endpoint via a POST request in JSON format.

#### API Request Queueing:

- To handle high demand, a method is suggested to queue API requests, ensuring new orders wait until the configured number of parallel requests are processed.

#### Web Form with IndexedDB:

- A simple web form is created with three input parameters.
- The submitted form values are stored in the browser-based IndexedDB.
- A data table is provided to view the stored information from IndexedDB.
